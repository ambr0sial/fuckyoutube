  FuckYouTube is a Python program that can retrieve a direct link from a YouTube URL.
</p>

## üåπ Introduction

FuckYouTube is a Python program that allows you to extract the direct link to a YouTube video from a provided YouTube URL. I especially made this to circumvent the latest implementation of YouTube's anti ad-blocker.

## ‚ú® Features

- Retrieves the direct link to a YouTube video.
- Supports the highest resolution video stream.
- Easy to use with a simple command-line interface.

## üå∏ Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ambr0sial/fuckyoutube.git
   ```

2. Go into the directory and run the program (pure if you don't want to use PyTube):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   python fuckyoutube.py
   
   or
   
   python fuckyoutube_pure.py
   ```

3. Follow the instructions you see on screen. You can now copy the direct link that has been fetched and paste it into your browser!
